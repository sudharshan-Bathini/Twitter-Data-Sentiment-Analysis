# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Twitter data to classify tweets into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction, and applies **machine learning models** to analyze and predict public sentiment effectively.

## Key Features
- Preprocess tweets: remove punctuation, URLs, mentions, hashtags, and stopwords.
- Convert text into numerical features using **TF-IDF** or **Bag-of-Words**.
- Train **machine learning models** such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, or Neural Networks.
- Evaluate model performance using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.
- Visualize results with sentiment distribution charts, word clouds, and trend graphs.
- Optional integration with **deep learning models** (LSTM/GRU) for advanced performance.

## Topics Covered
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization.  
- **Text Cleaning & Preprocessing**: normalization, removing noise, handling emojis.  
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, embeddings.  
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Naive Bayes.  
- **Data Visualization**: sentiment distribution, word clouds, trends.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.  
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: oversampling, undersampling techniques.  
    

## Dataset
The dataset consists of tweets collected using **Twitter API**, hashtags, or keywords. All tweets are preprocessed to remove noise and prepare them for analysis. Sample data can be included in `data/` folder.
